This folder contains fixedpoint implementamentations of the exponential function and the natural log function, in a mix of finished serpent code, python scripts that generate serpent code, and python scripts that generate and test different version of code. To see an example, run ./lagrange_math.py

Before you do that, however, you gotta install dependencies! Just use the requirements.txt file like so: "sudo pip install -r requirements.txt" (this is assuming you already have serpent and pyethereum cloned and installed from their develop branches.)
